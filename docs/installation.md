!!! warning ""

    Using this approach in `production` is `discouraged` though - the client has to download the entire library,
    regardless of which components are actually used, affecting performance and bandwidth utilization.

!!! danger ""

    The UMD links are using the `latest` tag to point to the latest version of the library. This pointer is `unstable`,
    it shifts as we release new versions. You should consider pointing to a specific version,
    such as [v1.4.6](https://unpkg.com/react-auth-kit@1.4.6/dist/index.umd.js).
